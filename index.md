## Welcome! 

The Institute for Natural Medicine is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, in collaboration with the [American Association of Naturopathic Physicians](https://naturopathic.org/). Our mission is to transform healthcare in America by increasing public awareness of naturopathic medicine and access to naturopathic doctors for patients.

We believe that naturopathic medicine, with its unique principles and practices, has the potential to reverse the tide of chronic illness that overwhelms existing health care systems. Naturopathic medicine empowers people to achieve and maintain their optimal lifelong health.
