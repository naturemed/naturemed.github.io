It may be a person who is responsible for the direct care, protection, and supervision of children in a child care home, or someone who tends to the needs of the elderly or disabled. It is generally one who gives assistance to another person who is no longer able to perform the critical tasks of personal or household care necessary for everyday survival. Caregivers are governed by federal and state laws, which vary by state. Various laws regulate eligibility and standards of conduct, such as abuse or neglect of a client or misappropriation of a client’s property.” (ref) [Read more about caregiving and its impact, here.](https://www.cdc.gov/aging/caregiving/index.htm)' %}
