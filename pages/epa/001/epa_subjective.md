  <p>Pathobiography: an assessment of the intensity of illness vs. the healing process. This includes, but is not limited to: history of present illness (HPI), past medical history (PMHx), family history (FHx), social history (SHx), psychospiritual history, dietary history, and  health history. Identify key turning points for the patient (e.g., “I’ve  not  been well since…”), along with potential toxic exposures; traumas; disturbances; and constitutional/inborn, strengths, weaknesses, and particularities.

  The physician listens intentionally and re-tells patient's story in a way that facilitates the therapeutic alliance. Approach is efficient, professional, and compassionate.
