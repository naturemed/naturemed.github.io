As primary care physicians, our role is to ensure the patient is up-to-date on all the age-appropriate screening exams needed. If there are no abnormals on examination or in the ROS, guidance on upcoming screening exams and counseling on safe health behaviors is our primary role.

Abnormals O/E or identified in ROS that are not urgent can be fully worked up and assessed at ROC. 

Well-adult exams suit naturopathic health care extremely well, as they are entirely preventive and require holistic history-taking, PE, and assessment.
