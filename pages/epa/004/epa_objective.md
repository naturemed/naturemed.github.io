## Evaluate functional systems
{% include callout.html content= '**Includes:**<br>- Overactivity<br>- Underactivity<br>- Burden<br>- Obstruction' type="info" %}
  
### Vital signs and PE
- Tests to differentiate psychosomatic, physical pain, and malingering
  -  E.g., points for diagnosing fibromyalgia

### RoS
- Endocrine
  - disorders such as:
    - Thyroid disorders (e.g., Hashimotoâ€™s)
    - Sex hormone deficiency
- Gastroenterological
  - conditions that can contribute to chronic pain such as: 
    - celiac disease
    - constipation
    - SIBO
- Neurological
  - Neuropathies and how they present in the context of chronic pain
    - Infectious conditions, e.g.:
    - EBV
    - Covid-19
- Psychological
  - Somatic disorders
  - Physical impact of mood disorders
  - Associatedpsycho-neuro-immunological dysfunction
  - Effects of substance abuse:
    - alcohol
    - opioids 

#### Expected Competencies
{% include callout.html content="- Does the resident appropriately categorize chronic pain in the correct category?<br><br>- Does the resident consider comorbidities (i.e., fibromyalgia and arthritis)?" type="danger" %}


### Other relevant systems
{% include callout.html content= 'Disturbances/ imbalances in:<br>- Physiologic systems<br>- Energetic systems<br>- Organ systems<br>- Cellular systems' type="info" %}

## Evaluate structural obstacles to cure

### Musculoskeletal
- MSK commonly associated with chronic pain, including: 
  - mechanical/postural dysfunction
  - connective tissue-related autoimmune disorders, such as:
    - fibromyalgia
    - spondyloarthropathies

## Assess wellness & pathology

### Vital force
{% include definition.html content= 'Vis medicatrix naturae: "an inherent self-healing process in people that is ordered and intelligent. Naturopathic physicians act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process." [AANP, 2022](https://naturopathic.org/page/PrinciplesNaturopathicMedicine?&hhsearchterms=%22vis+and+medicatrix+and+naturae%22))' %}

### Laboratory & imaging
- Determine age-appropriate screening exams, lab work, and imaging needed to confirm differential diagnosis

#### Expected Competencies
{% include callout.html content="- Understands when imaging and labs are/are not appropriate to support differential dx and affect treatment plan<br>- Understands when imaging is /is not appropriate<br>- Avoids unnecessary tests and consequent financial burden on patient." type="danger" %}

### DDx
{% include note.html content= 'Including ICD code' %}
