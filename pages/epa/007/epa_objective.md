### Vital signs and PE
- Vitals
- Breast exam 
- Lymph node palpation 
- Lymph drainage
    {% include rationale.html content= 'Lymph restriction due to bra /underwires' %}
- GI/Abd 
- Liver palpation
    {% include rationale.html content= '- Liver congestion<br/><br/>- Adrenal exhaustion<br/>- High E:P ratio' %}

#### Expected Competencies
{% include callout.html content="- Comprehensive clinical breast exam<br/>- Chest/abdominal exam<br/>- Pelvic exam as needed" type="danger" %}

- PG status
- Lactation status
- Genitourinary
- Gastrointestinal
  {% include rationale.html content= 'If constipated, recirculating HER2 estrogens E:P ratio elevated' %}
- Cardiovascular

### Other relevant systems
{% include callout.html content="Disturbances/ imbalances in:<br>- Physiologic systems<br>- Energetic systems<br>- Organ systems<br>- Cellular systems<br><br>- Overactivity<br>- Underactivity<br>- Burden<br>- Obstruction" type="info" %}

## Evaluate structural obstacles to cure
### Musculoskeletal
- SI
- Shoulder
  {% include rationale.html content= 'Slumping/poor posture to protect the chest' %}

## Assess wellness & pathology


### Laboratory & imaging
{% include note.html content="Determine age-appropriate screening exams, lab work, and imaging needed to confirm DDxg" %}
- Culture the discharge
  {% include rationale.html content= 'Know what you are treating.' %}
- Mammogram with follow- up ultrasound or MRI 
- Pap smear
- Hormone: high E:P ratio
- Adrenal exhaustion
  {% include rationale.html content= 'Breast lump due to hormonal imbalance<br/>- Majority of premenopausal breast lumps in females are d/t hormonal imbalance - usually unopposed estrogen d/t adrenal insufficiency and exogenous hormone exposure' %}



#### Expected Competencies
{% include callout.html content="- Understands when imaging and labs are/are not appropriate to support differential dx and affect treatment plan<br>- Understands when imaging is /is not appropriate<br>- Avoids unnecessary tests and consequent financial burden on patient." type="danger" %}
