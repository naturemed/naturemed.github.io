- Biological gender - M/F
- Gender identity
  - Transgender, non-binary, genderqueer, and gender non-conforming 
  - Trans 101
    {% include rationale.html content= 'Patients may have different terms for their genitalia - ask!<br><br>- Pronouns are important for charting and establishing patient trust. Pronouns reflect how we perceive someone’s gender.<br><br>- A transgender man probably was assigned female at birth and may have a vulva, uterus, cervix, ovaries, and breasts that must be examined, as for any cisgender female patient.<br/><br/>- Biological men – if dx BRCA, also has higher risk of secondary cancers (colon, rectal, prostate, pancreas, skin)<br/><br/>- Men with gynecomastia or Klinefelter’s syndrome have higher risk of BRCA and need to be r/o' %}
    {% include callout.html content="<br>- Onset<br> - Location<br> - Quality of relationships<br> - Duration<br> - Characterization<br> - Alleviating & aggravating factors<br> - Radiation<br> - Temporal factors<br> - Severity (1-10 scale)" type="info" %}

#### Expected Competencies
{% include callout.html content= "- Communication skills<br>- Professionalism<br>- Collaboration (patient)<br>- Collaboration (interprofessional)" type="danger" %}

### Outline patient goals collaboratively
- R/O malignancy 
- Treat infections appropriately 
- Appropriate referral as needed for further workup 

### Assess vital force, direction, pattern
{% include definition.html content= 'Vis medicatrix naturae: "an inherent self-healing process in people that is ordered and intelligent.

#### Expected Competencies

### PMHx
- Implants or surgery
  - Assess any underlying disease burden: e.g., diabetes, obesity, digestive disease, CV disease
- Personal history of cancers
- Menarche
  {% include rationale.html content= 'Majority of premenopausal breast lumps in females are d/t hormonal imbalance - usually unopposed estrogen due to adrenal insufficiency and exogenous hormone exposure.' %}
- Menopause
- Detox pathways

#### Expected Competencies
