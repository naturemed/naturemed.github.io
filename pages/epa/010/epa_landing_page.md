Menopause is a natural life stage, if it occurs after age 50 years. Normalize this transition for your patient. Early menopause onset (< age 50) can have a long-term detrimental impact. 
The clinician's main goals are to help patients minimize symptoms, and to protect musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and cognitive health.
